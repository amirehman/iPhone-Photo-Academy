# iPhone Photo Academy

As part of a job application process, I was given a task to implement a website using Vue 3. The task involved creating a contact form website with email validation, automatic loading of assets for high-resolution screens, and easy-to-read and maintain code.

## Implementation

* I used Vue 3's composition API for the project's implementation, choosing it over the Vue options API.
* When creating the iPhone mockup carousel, I had several options. I could have used the complete iPhone mockup with both small and big images to create one slide, or some other option. However, I chose to keep the image and iPhone mockup separate. This way, the small image, big image, and background glow are all obtained through an API, which makes it easy for future use. We can add, remove, or edit images without affecting the mockup, thus providing greater flexibility.
* To avoid incorrect email addresses being submitted, I implemented email validation on the input field.
* I also made sure that all images and other assets were automatically loaded in higher resolution for 2x and 3x retina screens.
* I implemented the website's functionality using Vue Router to redirect to a thank you page after the user submits the contact form.
* TailwindCSS is my preferred styling framework for this project because it is modern, highly flexible, and happens to be my personal favorite.
* I kept the code simple by not using third-party libraries which can be too much for small tasks. Instead, I focused on making the code easy to read and understand. I did this by following good coding practices, like using common names and organizing the code in a logical way with helpful notes.

## Deployment

After finishing the project, I made it available for recruiters to assess by deploying it on GitHub and sharing it through Vercel.
